# mk-chat-server

`mk-chat-client` is the server side of a legacy chat project (2013) that I migrate on github. This was a school project and I want to refund it to the actual Java tendacy. 
It needs the client part for the chat GUI. You can found it [here](https://github.com/rmikaia/mk-chat-client)
